In my work, I evaluate the spatial and temporal relationships between vegetation, climate, and disturbances such as fire, drought, cyclonic storms, and deforestation.\nMost recently, I’m interested in forest response to and recovery from fire and the post-fire impacts on forest ecosystem services like carbon storage and water resources."

    "text": "Currently, I am a Research Associate at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies working with Dr. Winslow D. Hansen.\n\nMy research is driven by the following question: How are climatic changes, disturbances, and human activities shaping forest resilience? From tropical to boreal systems, I link field surveys, remote sensing, geospatial/statistical analysis, and machine learning to evaluate resilience and disturbance in forests and forested watersheds. My research objectives are to 1) monitor forest function, disturbance, and recovery, 2) determine drivers and indicators of variability in disturbance magnitude and recovery dynamics, and 3) project future risk and resilience outcomes.\nIn my spare time, you’ll find me hiking with my dog, reading, gardening, and knitting. Also probably mentioning that I am from Wyoming one too many times."

    "text": "PhD Research\nMy PhD research drew from principles in ecology, hydrology, and geography to identify the effects of forest disturbance from extreme events on carbon sequestration and streamflow in Puerto Rico.\n\nStreamflow, forest cover, and drought in Puerto Rico\nIn Puerto Rico, streamflow provides over 80% of water used for human consumption, and limited water storage infrastructure has caused multiple water rationing periods during drought. To understand the relationships between forest cover, drought, and streamflow, my coauthors and I used hydrological and statistical techniques (Hall et al, 2022). We found that watersheds with high forest cover had consistently greater streamflow than deforested ones, even during periods of intense and prolonged drought. Our results demonstrated that forest cover, through increased water storage and infiltration, may lessen the impact of drought on streamflow in Puerto Rico.\n \n\n\nQuantifying forest damage from Hurricane Maria\nHurricane María hit Puerto Rico in 2017, causing widespread forest damage. To estimate forest damage extent (e.g., AGB loss), my coauthors and I combined field data and Sentinel-2 optical satellite imagery (Hall et al. 2020) and determined that 23% of pre-hurricane forest AGB was lost. We evaluated risk factors associated with damage severity caused by Hurricane María using random forest decision trees and found that storm-related rainfall was a strong predictor of forest damage. Expected increases in hurricane-associated rainfall highlight the need to consider how such shifts, together with high-speed winds, will affect terrestrial ecosystems.\n\n\nRelating forest damage to post-hurricane streamflow response\nFinally, we tested whether forest cover and estimates of forest damage explain changes to Puerto Rican streamflow regimes after Hurricane María (Hall et al. in revision). Using statistical models, we found that nearly all watersheds experienced higher post-storm streamflow. Forest damage increased streamflow after the storm, and forests, however damaged, increase resistance to storm impacts on streamflow. On average, major changes to streamflow regimes lasted months, but residual changes remained for over a year. Our results demonstrate how interactions between forest damage and cover influence streamflow regimes and increase understanding of forest damage effects on watershed function."

Together with my collaborators, I will compile water resource data and remote sensing indices for burned watersheds across the western US. We will use this dataset to evaluate how water resources have changed as a result of fires and to build a predictive statistical and machine learning model that uses projections of forests and fire characteristics to project future changes to water resources given climate, fire, and management scenarios.\n\n\n\nI am a co-PI on a recently started a project funded by the Joint Fire Science Program to assess the risk of forest carbon loss to fire in interior Alaska, predict forest recovery after fire for the next century, and project the impacts of potential management strategies.
