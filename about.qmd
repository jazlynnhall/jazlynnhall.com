Currently, I am a Research Associate at the [Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies](https://www.caryinstitute.org/) working with [Dr. Winslow D. Hansen](https://forestfutureslab.org/).

My research is driven by the following question: **How are climatic changes, disturbances, and human activities shaping forest resilience?** From tropical to boreal systems, I link field surveys, remote sensing, geospatial/statistical analysis, and machine learning to evaluate resilience and disturbance in forests and forested watersheds. My research objectives are to [*1) monitor forest function, disturbance, and recovery, 2) determine drivers and indicators of variability in disturbance magnitude and recovery dynamics, and 3) project future risk and resilience outcomes*]{.underline}*.*

In my spare time, you'll find me hiking with my dog, reading, gardening, and knitting. Also probably mentioning that I am from Wyoming one too many times.
